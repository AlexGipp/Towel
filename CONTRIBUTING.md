## How Can You Help?

#### Open An Issue

If you notice anything that can be improved about the Towel project please [create a new issue](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub repository. This could be a bug fix, a possible enhancement, or anything else regarding the project. Creating an issue is just a public post that anyone can see and comment on.

#### Share The Project

Sharing the project with other programmers is a big help. The more eyes on the project the more input can be provided to make the project better.

#### Writing Tutorials, Articles, and Blog Posts

Towel is lacking proper documentation. Writing tutorials, articles, and/or blog posts about the project would be a big help. Let the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers) know about your content, and it might be linked to from the project README.

#### Show Off How You Use Towel

If you use the Towel in a project and are willing to show it off, message the [project developer(s)](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel#developers) and your project or branding might be linked to from the project README. Showing an active user base would be a big help.

#### Chat on Discord

You can chat with the developer(s) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4XbQbwF). They can give you more specific information on what would currently benefit the project.

#### Development

If you want to help out with the development of the code, contributing will involve the standard GitHub processes of forking the code and creating a pull request. Any issues marked as [Good First Issue](https://github.com/ZacharyPatten/Towel/contribute)s will generally be the best starting points for helping out. Visual Studio 2019 is the prefered environment for development. Just open the Towel.sln file and the project should build without any configuration.
